# Requirements
* This ANE is dependent on **androidSupport.ane** and **overrideAir.ane**. Download them from [here](https://github.com/myflashlab/common-dependencies-ANE).
* Android SDK 15 or higher
* iOS 8.0 or higher

# Permissions
If you are targeting AIR 24 or higher, you need to [take care of the permissions mannually](http://www.myflashlabs.com/adobe-air-app-permissions-android-ios/). Below are the list of Permissions this ANE might require. (Note: *Necessary Permissions* are those that the ANE will NOT work without them and *Optional Permissions* are those which are needed only if you are using some specific features in the ANE.)

Check out the demo project available at this repository to see how we have used our [PermissionCheck ANE](http://www.myflashlabs.com/product/native-access-permission-check-settings-menu-air-native-extension/) to ask for the permissions.

**Necessary Permissions:**  
none

**Optional Permissions:**  

1. PermissionCheck.SOURCE_STORAGE
